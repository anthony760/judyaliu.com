                        <h1>Welcome</h1>
                        <p>Welcome! I invite you to browse through this website. I understand 
                        that life is busy and there is a lot to do, so I made this site as 
                        focused and concise as I could. This was done to make your journey 
                        through this site as simple and easy as possible. There is information 
                        here about me, (Judy Liu), so you have an opportunity to get a sense of 
                        who I am, how I work, what my priorities are and what commitments I am 
                        making to you. Then you can determine if these aspects are compatible 
                        with your values and if they satisfy the requirements you are looking 
                        for in a Life Coach or a Therapist. <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Hopefully you will relax some and even experience some nurturing as 
                        you view some of the photos interspersed with the text. In all my 
                        studies regarding the latest info on brain research and our neurology I 
                        have really learned how important our sensory experience is as a 
                        contributor to balancing our brain. When our brain is balanced then we 
                        are more balanced! Please be sure to review the “Heart Breath” as a 
                        balancing tool to quiet your mind and reduce anxiety. </p>
                        <p>I conduct workshops, in service presentations for office staff, 
                        groups as well as one to one, couple and family sessions. If you have 
                        any questions please feel free to contact me (check the contact info for 
                        direct access to me). I would be happy to arrange a free 30 minute 
                        sample session if you are interested. I have an office in Mammoth Lakes, CA 
                        at 549 Old Mammoth Road, Suite 10, and an office in North County San Diego
                        where I see people face to face. However most of my sessions are phone 
                        sessions.
                        </p>
                        <p>I hope you enjoy your experience here. I look forward to connecting 
                        with you soon!</p>
